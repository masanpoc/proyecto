# **Website template built for musicians**

# DESCRIPTION

Link - https://mariocirer.com // https://masanpoc.github.io/proyecto/
(deployed with gh-pages)

This repository is a desktop/mobile React app built with create-react-app that has the following useful to have components:

* Responsive Carousel with Autoplay
* Article
* Audio player
* Storyline with pinning and audio play/based on scroll-position
* Intro with magnifier effect + split word effect
* Responsive menu
* Responsive footer
* Consistent design across sections (fonts, dimensions, color palette...)  

Libraries used: GSAP, Use-Sound

Feel free to clone this repo and copy any piece of code you might find want to include in your projects (e.g.: styles, components, state logic...). 

There is still pending work to be done, most of it animation-related and only problematic in the deployed website:
  * The carousel starts incorrectly but works properly
  * The intro doesn't load smoothly and stops/freezes for a moment
  * Audio sprites of the storyline section take some seconds to load in mobile devices (might not be a bug)

You shouldn't have any problem cloning this repo and running npm start to start the app.
